To successfully run the app, set up the following environment variables:

* OJS_DB_URL, OJS_DB_USER, OJS_DB_PASSWD - URL, user and password for the OJS database

* INTERNAL_DB_URL, INTERNAL_DB_USER, INTERNAL_DB_PASSWD - URL, user and password for the internal MySQL database

* SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWD - proper config for the SMTP server

Sample config (excluding, however, *_PASSWD variables, which still need to be set manually) is stored in env-setup/dev.sh
