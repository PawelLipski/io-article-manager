To run the app itself, first unpack the provided stand-alone zipball.
The only requirement is Java installed (no dependency on Scala nor Play framework).
System has been tested for JRE 1.7, but should work with 1.6 as well.

Then set up the following environment variables:

* OJS_DB_URL, OJS_DB_USER, OJS_DB_PASSWD - URL, user and password for the OJS database

* INTERNAL_DB_URL, INTERNAL_DB_USER, INTERNAL_DB_PASSWD - URL, user and password for the internal MySQL database

* SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWD - config for the SMTP server

Sample config (excluding, however, *_PASSWD variables, which still need to be set manually) is stored in env-setup/dev.sh.
The proper way to run this is script is via Bash `source' command:
$ . conf/dev.sh
from the unzipped app folder.

To run the app, simply launch:
$ ./bin/ioarticlemanager
